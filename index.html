                        <li class="quoteone"><span class="chatBox">I started my child in Wendy's daycare when she first opened daycare in her home. Way back in 1994. Since then I have had 3 children and we have continued with Wendy even when she opened Bear Essentials Academy. My children think of Wendy as their second mom. She truly loves all the children she provides care for. Her staff is just as wonderful as Wendy is.<p>-Heather</p></span></li>
                        <li class="quotetwo"><span class="chatBox">My daughter has been going to Bear Essentials since she was four months old. The moment I walked in, even before she was born, the atmosphere was welcome and secure. The staff has always been great, and I feel the love they have for the kids they provide care to. My daughter is always excited to go to daycare, and I am confident she is well taken care of. I have never walked into chaos and it is always clean. The kids are happy to be there and love their car takers/friends. I have moved since taking my daughter to Bear Essentials and although the drive is out of my way, I just can't imagine taking her anywhere else. I am very grateful to Wendy and her staff.<p>-Cali</p> </span></li>
                        <li class="quotethree"><span class="chatBox">I found Bear Essentials academy through a friend of mine. Her children go there and she has been very happy. My children started attending last month. I have been very pleased with the care my children receive. <p>A.N.P. Mother of two</p></span></li>
                        <li class="quotefour"><span class="chatBox">My child has been enrolled at Bear Essentials for three years now. She looks forward to going  every day. Wendy has been very good at working with my payment. She is very good to me and my child.<p>Mary</p></span></li>
                        <li class="quotefive"><span class="chatBox">My child has been enrolled at bear essentials academy since 2010. We have been very happy with all the staff there. My daughter loves it, she even ask to go to day care on the weekends. It is so nice to go to work each day and know that my child is being well taken care of. <p>Lori</p></span>></li>
